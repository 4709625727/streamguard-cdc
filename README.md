# streamguard-cdc

**A production-shaped change-data-capture pipeline: Postgres stays the source of truth, everything downstream stays in sync in seconds, not hours.**

## The real problem

Every mid-to-large SaaS eventually needs its search index, its cache, its analytics warehouse, or a downstream microservice to reflect what just changed in the OLTP database - and the two ways people reach for first are both bad:

- **Polling** ("SELECT * WHERE updated_at > last_poll") wastes database connections, misses hard deletes unless you bolt on soft-delete flags everywhere, and either lags behind or hammers the primary.
- **Nightly batch ETL** is stale by definition - a support agent looking at "customer's current plan" in the analytics DB can be looking at yesterday's answer.

The standard fix is **Change Data Capture (CDC)**: read the database's own write-ahead log, turn every committed row change into an event, and stream those events to whoever needs them. That's what this repo builds, end to end: a real Postgres logical-replication source, a real Debezium connector, a real Kafka-compatible broker, a stream processor with the three things that make CDC pipelines hard in practice (deduplication, schema evolution, windowed aggregation), and a real analytical sink.

Postgres WAL -> Debezium connector -> Kafka topics -> stream processor (dedupe, schema evolution, windowed aggregation) -> ClickHouse sink, with a dead-letter topic branch and a Grafana lag/throughput monitor tap.

## Quick start

### Run the pipeline logic offline (no Docker, 2 seconds)

```bash
pip install -e ".[dev]"
pytest -v                         # 83 unit tests, all in-memory
python3 scripts/run_offline_demo.py   # end-to-end demo: 500 synthetic
                                       # orders -> dedupe/schema-evolution/
                                       # windowing -> in-memory ClickHouse
```

### Run the real stack

```bash
docker compose up -d
./scripts/register-connector.sh     # wire Debezium to Postgres + Kafka

# generate OLTP load so there's something to capture
docker compose exec streamguard-processor python -c "
from streamguard.loadgen import PostgresLoadGenerator, LoadGenConfig
PostgresLoadGenerator('postgresql://streamguard:streamguard@postgres:5432/streamguard').run(
    LoadGenConfig(num_orders=1000)
)"

open http://localhost:3000           # Grafana (admin/admin) -- lag & throughput dashboard
open http://localhost:8123/play      # ClickHouse SQL playground
```

## How it works

**1. Postgres -> Debezium.** `infra/postgres/init.sql` creates the `orders`/`customers` tables with `REPLICA IDENTITY FULL` and a logical replication publication. Debezium's Postgres connector (`infra/debezium/connector-config.json`) reads the WAL through that publication and emits one JSON envelope per row change (`{before, after, source: {lsn, table}, op}`) onto a Kafka topic per table.

**2. Kafka -> stream processor.** `streamguard/pipeline.py`'s `StreamProcessor` polls each topic and, per record:

- **Parses** the Debezium envelope (`streamguard/events.py`); anything structurally broken or missing required fields is dead-lettered, not fatal.
- **Deduplicates** (`streamguard/dedup.py`) using a bounded, TTL-based seen-set keyed on `(table, primary key, WAL LSN)` - the stable identity of one committed change - so a Kafka rebalance or Debezium restart replaying old offsets doesn't double-count anything.
- **Reconciles schema** (`SchemaRegistry` in `streamguard/events.py`): tracks the observed column set per table and, when a row shows up with a new or missing column (an `ALTER TABLE` rolling out), widens the known set and backfills missing columns with `None` instead of crashing or silently dropping data.
- **Feeds the windowed aggregator** (`streamguard/windowing.py`): a tumbling-window accumulator with a watermark, so a 1-minute "revenue per store" aggregate only closes and gets written once the pipeline is confident no more (reasonably) late events are coming for that window - and out-of-order events within the lateness grace period still land in the right window.
- **Writes to ClickHouse** (`streamguard/clickhouse_sink.py`): row upserts use `ReplacingMergeTree`-style version semantics (highest WAL LSN wins), deletes are tombstoned rather than physically removed, and finalized aggregation windows are appended to a separate table.
- **Anything that throws along the way** - a malformed event, a schema validation failure, a sink write error - is routed to the `streamguard.dlq` dead-letter topic (`streamguard/dlq.py`) with the original payload, error type/message, and source offset, and the consumer keeps moving instead of stalling the whole pipeline.

**3. Observability.** `streamguard/metrics.py` tracks consumed/dedup/DLQ/schema-change/window/sink-write counters and consumer lag, exposed as Prometheus text on `/metrics`; `infra/grafana/` provisions a dashboard (`infra/grafana/provisioning/dashboards/streamguard-lag-throughput.json`) showing lag, throughput, and DLQ/duplicate/schema-change counts alongside a live ClickHouse revenue-per-store panel.

**4. Load generation.** `streamguard/loadgen.py` has two faces: a real `PostgresLoadGenerator` that issues INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE against the Docker-composed Postgres (giving Debezium real WAL traffic), and a pure Python `synthetic_debezium_events()` generator that deterministically reproduces the same messy realities - redelivered duplicates, malformed records, a schema change partway through the stream, a late update and delete - without any external service, which is what the entire unit test suite and the offline demo run against.

## Design choices that make this testable without Docker

Every piece of I/O the pipeline needs - a Kafka consumer/producer, a ClickHouse sink - is defined as a small `Protocol` in `streamguard/kafka_io.py` / `streamguard/clickhouse_sink.py`. The real adapters (`RedpandaConsumer`, `RedpandaProducer`, `RealClickHouseSink`) lazily import their client libraries (`confluent_kafka`, `requests`) only when actually instantiated, so importing - and unit-testing - `streamguard` never requires them installed. The in-memory implementations (`InMemoryBroker`, `InMemoryConsumer`, `InMemoryProducer`, `InMemorySink`) are faithful enough models of real broker/ClickHouse semantics (offsets, high watermarks, `ReplacingMergeTree` version resolution, tombstones, a killable/revivable broker for failure injection) that `StreamProcessor` runs identically against either.

## Testing

```bash
pytest -v                    # 83 unit tests, pure in-memory, ~0.1s
pytest --cov=streamguard      # coverage
```

The main test command needs no Docker daemon, no network, and no real cluster - see the "Design choices" section above for why. A fully optional, Docker-backed integration suite lives at `tests/integration/test_testcontainers_e2e.py`; it is skipped by default and only runs if you explicitly opt in:

```bash
pip install -e ".[integration]"
RUN_INTEGRATION_TESTS=1 pytest tests/integration/ -v
```

`docs/FAILURE_INJECTION.md` documents (and `tests/test_failure_injection.py` verifies, offline) the "kill Kafka mid-stream, verify no data loss" test this project's scope calls for.
